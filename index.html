                        Coding was a skill I learned to love early on in life.

                        Creativity has always been my most favored trait. Having thoughts and ideas for the things I do paints the world in an unique perspective. I heavily expanded on this trait in elementary school when my mother signed me up for a coding summer camp where I learned to harness a tool to transform my thoughts into a reality.

                        Growing up in a smaller town limited the technology classes available to me, but the internet opened the doors for me to pick up the basics of coding on my own. Between sports, school, and music, I would spend my time online finding tutorials for different programming languages. I found a lot of satisfaction in completing 100% of the courses. This was a great start to my career, but it was difficult for me to comprehend some of the more specific topics like frameworks, environments, and coding principles. It wasn't until I began attending Michigan Technological University that I was able to dive into these areas.

                        During my time in college, I was able to hone my skills in development through my classes, organizations and internships. I began working on several projects where I could use the languages I had a basic understanding of. I often used Java and C for development in my classes, along with having specific courses dive into Algorithms, AI Development, and Concurrent Programing. In my enterprise organization, I learned to utilize front-end languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while Python was used for the back-end. In my internships, I gained a bulk of coding experience, picking up skills like REST Services, Git, and C# along with Microsoft's .NET Framework. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After Graduating, my developed skills led me into the professional world where I continue to learn and improve upon my ability. On top of that, continuing to bring my creativity to life through work.
